# Ready Set Roll for 5e - FoundryVTT Module
**Ready Set Roll** is a Foundry VTT module that accelerates the built in rolling system of the [Foundry DnD5e system](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e). It allows for quick rolls with advantage, disadadvantage, and other modifiers for skills, items, ability checks, and saving throws. This module is a complete rewrite and modernisation of [RedReign](https://github.com/RedReign)'s [Better Rolls for 5e](https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e) module, which is no longer supported, and no longer functional as of more recent versions of FoundryVTT.

## Implemented Features

### Quick Rolls
- Rolls for skills, abilities, and items (can be enabled or disabled individually for each category of rolls) are outputted automatically to chat instead of relying on the default roll dialog system. 
- Using modifier keys such as `shift` and `ctrl` allows for the roll to immediately output with advantage or disadvantage, and will automatically add in any required additional rolls (e.g. for Elven Accuracy).
- Items will automatically output damage, calculate critical damage (taking into account system settings for powerful criticals or critical numerical modifiers), place area templates, print Save DC buttons, and a variety of other options that can all be configured independently for each item.
