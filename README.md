# Ready Set Roll for 5e - FoundryVTT Module
**Ready Set Roll** is a Foundry VTT module that accelerates the built in rolling system of the [Foundry DnD5e system](https://github.com/foundryvtt/dnd5e). It allows for quick rolls with advantage, disadadvantage, and other modifiers for skills, items, ability checks, and saving throws. This module is a complete rewrite and modernisation of [RedReign](https://github.com/RedReign)'s [Better Rolls for 5e](https://github.com/RedReign/FoundryVTT-BetterRolls5e) module, which is no longer supported, and no longer functional as of more recent versions of FoundryVTT.
